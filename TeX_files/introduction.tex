\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is the simulation of the complete structure realizing a four element array with amplitude tapering, obtaining a SLL of -20 dB.

\par\medskip
\noindent
The design is the same one we proposed in the previous assignment, but all the components will undergo a process of optimization in order to make us able to provide reliable and complete simulations finally attesting the correct behavior of the structure.

\par\medskip
\noindent
The first part will deal with the simulation and optimization of the power splitters that will later be inserted in the BFN. Both the even and uneven power splitter will be tested in order to identify the discontinuities present in the model and minimizing their effect.


\par\medskip
\noindent
The second part is related to the simulation of the BFN, in order to verify if the previously optimized splitters still work the right way when united in a single model and to correct the structure if not.


\par\medskip
\noindent
Last, in the third and final part, the complete antenna will be tested and its radiating properties will finally be verified, allowing us to finally understand if the BFN feeds the structure in a way that fulfills the design requirements or not.

\par\medskip
\noindent
At the end of the three described phases, a cad file will be produced containing the information about the final structure a producer would need in order to print the antenna.
